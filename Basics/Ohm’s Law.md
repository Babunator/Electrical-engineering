# Ohm’s Law
### Voltage, Current, and Resistance
- This continuous movement of electric charge through the conductors of a circuit is called a *current*, and it is often referred to in terms of “flow,” just like the flow of a liquid through a hollow pipe.
- The force motivating charge carriers to “flow” in a circuit is called *voltage*. Voltage is a specific measure of potential energy that is always relative between two points.
- Current tends to move through the conductors with some degree of friction, or opposition to motion. This opposition to motion is more properly called *resistance*.
