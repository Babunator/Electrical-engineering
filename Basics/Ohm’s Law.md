# Ohm’s Law
### Voltage, Current, and Resistance
- This continuous movement of electric charge through the conductors of a circuit is called a *current*, and it is often referred to in terms of “flow,” just like the flow of a liquid through a hollow pipe.
- *Voltage* is the measure of potential energy per unit charge available to motivate current flow from one point to another.
- Current tends to move through the conductors with some degree of friction, or opposition to motion. This opposition to motion is more properly called *resistance*.
- The amount of current in a circuit depends on the amount of voltage and the amount of resistance in the circuit to oppose current flow.

- The unit *coulomb* is a measure of electric charge proportional to the number of electrons in an imbalanced state. One coulomb of charge is equal to 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons. The symbol for electric charge quantity is the capital letter *Q,* with the unit of coulombs abbreviated by the capital letter *C.*
- The unit for current flow, the amp, is equal to 1 coulomb of charge passing by a given point in a circuit in 1 second.
- Voltage is the measure of potential energy per unit charge available. The general metric unit for energy of any kind is the joule, equal to the amount of work performed by a force of 1 newton exerted through a motion of 1 meter. 1 volt is equal to 1 joule of electric potential energy per (divided by) 1 coulomb of charge. Thus, a 9-volt battery releases 9 joules of energy for every coulomb of charge moved through a circuit.

### The Ohm’s Law Equation
Volltage (V or E) is equal to current (I) multiplied by resistance (R).
```
V=I*R or E=I*R
```

### Power and Joule’s Law
- *Power* is a measure of how much work can be performed in a given amount of time. 
- In electric circuits, power is a function of both voltage and current. The unit of measurement for power is the watt, abbreviated with the letter *W.*
```
P=I*E
```
- Power is a function of voltage multiplied by current, and both voltage and current doubled from their previous values, the power will increase by a factor of 2 x 2, or 4.

```
P=I*E    P=E^2/R   P=I^2*R
```
