# Resistors Basics
- Devices called resistors are built to provide precise amounts of resistance in electric circuits. Resistors are rated both in terms of their resistance (ohms) and their ability to dissipate heat energy (watts).
- They are typically constructed of metal wire or carbon .
- The schematic symbol for a resistor is a zig-zag line. Resistor values in ohms are usually shown as an adjacent number, and if several resistors are present in a circuit, they will be labeled with a unique identifier number such as R1, R2, R3, etc.<br />

 - An alternative schematic symbol for a resistor looks like a small, rectangular box.<br />

  - Resistors can also be shown to have varying rather than fixed resistances. Variable resistors must have some physical means of adjustment, either a rotating shaft or lever that can be moved to vary the amount of electrical resistance<br />

# Power Rating of Resistors
- Because resistors dissipate heat energy as the electric currents through them overcome the “friction” of their resistance, resistors are also rated in terms of how much heat energy they can dissipate without overheating and sustaining damage. 
-  Naturally, this power rating is specified in the physical unit of “watts.” Most resistors found in small electronic devices such as portable radios are rated at 1/4 (0.25) watt or less.
- Resistor resistance ratings cannot be determined from the physical size of the resistor(s) in question, although approximate power ratings can. The larger the resistor is, the more power it can safely dissipate without suffering damage.

# Resistor Color Codes
-  Since resistors are physically small, it's impractical to print the value of the resistor on it. Manufacturers mark resistors with three to five colored bands that indicate their value.<br />

# Variable Resistors
- Resistors can also be shown to have varying rather than fixed resistances. Variable resistors must have some physical means of adjustment, either a rotating shaft or lever that can be moved to vary the amount of electrical resistance<br />

- There are two major classes of variable resistors so its rheostats and potentiometers.
- Rheostats they usually have two terminals and the resistance between the two terminals changes. he first connection is made to one end of the resistive element and the other connection to the wiper (sliding contact). 
- Potentiometers they usually have three terminals and the resistance between the two end terminals does not change. If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat.


# Resistor Technology / Materials
## Carbon Composition (CCR) Resistors
- A mixture of fine carbon particles and non-conductive ceramic material are used for the resistive element of CCR Resistors.
- The substance is molded into the shape of a cylinder and baked. The dimensions of the body and the ratio of carbon to ceramic material determine the resistance value. More carbon used in the process means there will be a lower resistance. Power ratings can be increased by making the resistor larger.
- They are reliable, but not very accurate (their tolerance cannot be better than about 5%). CCR resistors are still useful for certain applications because of their ability to withstand high energy pulses, a good example application would be in a power supply.

## Wirewound (WW) Resistors
- Wire Wound Resistors are manufactured by winding resistance wire around a non-conductive core in a spiral. The core is usually made of ceramic or fiberglass, and the resistance wire is made of nickel-chromium alloy.
- The resistor value is determined by first of all the type of wire and then the diameter. (The thicker the wire the less the resistance and the length of the wire, the longer the wire the great the resistance.)
- They are typically produced for high precision and power applications. They are not suitable for applications with frequencies higher than 50kHz.
- Low noise and stability with respect to temperature variations are standard characteristics of Wire Wound Resistors. Resistance values are available from 0.1 up to 100 kΩ, with accuracies between 0.1% and 20%.

## Film Resistors
- Film resistors, they're made by depositing a thin layer off resistive material onto an insulating tube or rod called the substrate (commonly ceramic). 
- It's made by depositing a thin layer of resistive material around that substrate. The resistive layer is trimmed with an industrial laser until it has the desired resistance. 
- The thinner the layer of resistive material, the higher the resistance will be. 
- The leads are attached to the end caps, which contact the resistive film.

### Metal Film Resistors
- Nichrome or tantalum nitride is typically used for metal film resistors. A combination of a ceramic material and a metal typically make up the resistive material. The resistance value is changed by cutting a spiral pattern in the film, much like carbon film with a laser or abrasive. 
- Metal film resistors are usually less stable over temperature than wire wound resistors but handle higher frequencies better.

### Metal Oxide Film Resistors
- Metal oxide resistors use metal oxides such as tin oxide, making them slightly different from metal film resistors. 
- These resistors are reliable and stable and operate at higher temperatures than metal film resistors. Because of this, metal oxide film resistors are used in applications that require high endurance.

### Foil Resistors
- The foil resistor is  one of the most accurate and stable types of resistor that you’ll find and are used for applications with high precision requirements. 
- A ceramic substrate that has a thin bulk metal foil cemented to it makes up the resistive element. Foil Resistors feature a very low-temperature coefficient of resistance.

### Carbon Film Resistors
- Carbon film resistors have a thin carbon film (with a spiral cut in the film to increase the resistive path) on an insulating cylindrical core. 
- This allows for the resistance value to be more accurate and also increases the resistance value. Carbon film resistors are much more accurate than carbon composition resistors. 
- Special carbon film resistors are used in applications that require high pulse stability.

## Surface-mount technology
- These have no leads. Their contacts solder directly to the circuit board pads.
- Surface-mount resistors are used on computer system boards and other applications where components need to be very small. Surface-mount resistor markings, many surface-mount components have no visible markings and must be measured with test equipment to determine their value.
