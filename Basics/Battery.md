# Voltaic Cells
- Atoms bound together by electrons are called molecules.
- Ionic bonds are molecular unions formed when an electron-deficient atom (a positive ion) joins with an electron-excessive atom (a negative ion).
- Electrochemical reactions involve the transfer of electrons between atoms. This transfer can be harnessed to form an electric current.
- A voltaic cell, or cell for short, usually consisting of two metal electrodes immersed in a chemical mixture (called an electrolyte) designed to facilitate such an electrochemical (oxidation/reduction) reaction:<br/>

- A cell is a device constructed to harness such chemical reactions to generate electric current.
- The voltage produced by any particular kind of cell is determined strictly by the chemistry of that cell type.
- If the electrodes of the cell are connected to an external circuit, thelectrons have a place to flow from one to the other.
- In the common “lead-acid” cell (the kind commonly used in automobiles), the negative electrode is made of lead (Pb) and the positive is made of lead (IV) dioxide (PbO2), both metallic substances. he electrolyte solution is a dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4 + H2O.
- lead(IV) atoms in the positive electrode (PbO2) will gain two electrons each to produce Pb(II)O. The oxygen atoms which are “leftover” combine with positively charged hydrogen ions (H)+to form water (H2O). This flow of electrons into the lead dioxide (PbO2) electrode gives it a positive electrical charge. 
- Led atoms in the negative electrode give up two electrons each to produce lead Pb(II), which combines with sulfate ions (SO4-2) produced from the dissociation of the hydrogen ions (H+) from the sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to form lead sulfate (PbSO4). The flow of electrons out of the lead electrode gives it a negative electrical charge.<br/>

- A cell is said to be discharged when its internal chemical reserves have been depleted through use.
- In a Lead-acid battery this will be, when all of the sulfuric acid has been exhausted, the result will be two electrodes of lead sulfate (PbSO4) and an electrolyte solution of pure water (H2O), leaving no more capacity for additional ionic bonding.
- Lead-acid cell charge can be assessed with an instrument called a hydrometer, which measures the density of the electrolyte liquid. The denser the electrolyte, the stronger the acid concentration, and the greater charge state of the cell. (Sulfuric acid is denser than water)
- The chemical reactions of some types of cells can be reversed by forcing electric current backward through the cell (in the negative electrode and out the positive electrode). This process is called charging
- A secondary cell’s chemistry can be reversed (recharged) by forcing current backward through it.
- A primary cell cannot be practically recharged.

# Battery Construction
- A battery is a cluster of cells connected together for greater voltage and/or current capacity.
- The symbol for a cell is very simple, consisting of one long line and one short line. symbol for a battery is couple of cell symbols stacked in series.<br/>

- Symbol for a battery with unusually high voltage is intentionally drawn with extra lines:<br/>

- Cells connected together in series (polarities aiding) results in greater total voltage. (For example a typical automotive lead-acid battery (12V) has six cells (2V).
- Physical cell size impacts cell resistance, which in turn impacts the ability for the cell to supply current to a circuit. The larger a cell is constructed, the greater the electrode contact area with the electrolyte, and thus the less internal resistance it will have.
- Cells connected together in parallel results in less total resistance, and potentially greater total current

# Battery Ratings
- The amp-hour is a unit of battery energy capacity, equal to the amount of continuous current multiplied by the discharge time, that a battery can supply before exhausting its internal store of chemical energy.
- ![](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/uploads/articles/amp-hour.jpg)
- An amp-hour battery rating is only an approximation of the battery’s charge capacity and should be trusted only at the current level or time specified by the manufacturer. Such a rating cannot be extrapolated for very high currents or very long times with any accuracy.
- Discharged batteries lose voltage and increase in resistance. The best check for a dead battery is a voltage test under load.
