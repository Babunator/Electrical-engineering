# How does a Voltaic Cell work? 
- Atoms bound together by electrons are called molecules.
- Ionic bonds are molecular unions formed when an electron-deficient atom (a positive ion) joins with an electron-excessive atom (a negative ion).
- Electrochemical reactions involve the transfer of electrons between atoms. This transfer can be harnessed to form an electric current.
- A voltaic cell, or cell for short, usually consisting of two metal electrodes immersed in a chemical mixture (called an electrolyte) designed to facilitate such an electrochemical (oxidation/reduction) reaction:

- A cell is a device constructed to harness such chemical reactions to generate electric current.
- If the electrodes of the cell are connected to an external circuit, thelectrons have a place to flow from one to the other.
- In the common “lead-acid” cell (the kind commonly used in automobiles), the negative electrode is made of lead (Pb) and the positive is made of lead (IV) dioxide (PbO2), both metallic substances. he electrolyte solution is a dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4 + H2O.
- lead(IV) atoms in the positive electrode (PbO2) will gain two electrons each to produce Pb(II)O. The oxygen atoms which are “leftover” combine with positively charged hydrogen ions (H)+to form water (H2O). This flow of electrons into the lead dioxide (PbO2) electrode gives it a positive electrical charge. 
- Led atoms in the negative electrode give up two electrons each to produce lead Pb(II), which combines with sulfate ions (SO4-2) produced from the dissociation of the hydrogen ions (H+) from the sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to form lead sulfate (PbSO4). The flow of electrons out of the lead electrode gives it a negative electrical charge.

- A cell is said to be discharged when its internal chemical reserves have been depleted through use.
- A secondary cell’s chemistry can be reversed (recharged) by forcing current backward through it.
- A primary cell cannot be practically recharged.
- Lead-acid cell charge can be assessed with an instrument called a hydrometer, which measures the density of the electrolyte liquid. The denser the electrolyte, the stronger the acid concentration, and the greater charge state of the cell.
