#  Conductors

- **Excited-state Atom**: When an electron is free to assume higher energy states around an atom’s nucleus , it may be free to break away from the atom and comprise part of an electric current through the substance. --> conducting materials
- **Ground-state Atom**: The electron is considered to be “bound” and cannot break away (at least not easily) to constitute a current. -->  insulating materials
- Electrical conductivity of a material is determined by the configuration of electrons in that materials atoms and molecules (groups of bonded atoms).
  - A good example of this is the element carbon, which comprises materials of vastly differing conductivity: *graphite and diamond*. Graphite is a fair conductor of electricity, while diamond is practically an insulator
  - The difference between graphite and diamond being that graphite molecules are flat groupings of carbon atoms while diamond molecules are tetrahedral (pyramid-shaped) groupings of carbon atoms.
- The intentional introduction of impurities into an intrinsic semiconductor for the purpose of altering its electrical, optical, and structural properties is called doping.
- All metallic elements are good conductors of electricity, due to the way the atoms bond with each other. The electrons of the atoms comprising a mass of metal are so uninhibited in their allowable energy states that they float freely between the different nuclei in the substance, readily motivated by any electric field.
  - This electron mobility accounts for some of the other common properties of metals: good heat conductivity, malleability and ductility (easily formed into different shapes), and a lustrous finish when pure.
-  All normal conductors possess resistance to some degree. 
  - special types of materials called superconductors possess absolutely no electrical resistance, but these are not ordinary materials, and they must be held in special conditions in order to be super conductive) 
- Current flowing through a conductor with (any) resistance will produce some amount of voltage drop across the length of that conductor.

# Conductor Size
- **fw of electrons through conductors**the broader the cross-sectional area (thickness) of the conductor, the more room for electrons to flow, and consequently, the easier it is for flow to occur (less resistance).
