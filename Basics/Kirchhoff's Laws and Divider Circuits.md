# Voltage Divider Formula
A series circuit is often called a voltage divider for its ability to proportion—or divide—the total voltage into fractional portions of constant ratio. <br/>

The ratio of individual resistance to total resistance is the same as the ratio of individual voltage drop to the total supply voltage in a voltage divider circuit. This is known as the voltage divider formula, and it is a short-cut method for determining voltage drop in a series circuit without going through the current calculations of Ohm’s Law.

## Voltage - Dividing Components

Voltage dividers find wide application in electric meter circuits, where specific combinations of series resistors are used to “divide” a voltage into precise proportions as part of a voltage measurement device.<br/>
One device frequently used as a voltage-dividing component is the potentiometer, which is a resistor with a movable element.

# Current Divider Formula
Parallel circuits proportion, or “divide,” the total circuit current among individual branch currents, the proportions being strictly dependent upon resistances: In = ITotal (RTotal / Rn) <br/>

The ratio of total resistance to individual resistance is the same ratio as the individual (branch) current to the total current. This is known as the current divider formula, and it is a short-cut method for determining branch currents in a parallel circuit when the total current is known.<br/>

# Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)

**“The algebraic sum of all voltages in a loop must equal zero”** <br/>
By algebraic, I mean accounting for signs (polarities) as well as magnitudes. By loop, I mean any path traced from one point in a circuit around to other points in that circuit, and finally back to the initial point.

Here we see what a digital voltmeter would indicate across each component in an example series circuit: <br/>

Notice the polarities of the resistor voltage drops with respect to the battery: the battery’s voltage is negative on the left and positive on the right, whereas all the resistor voltage drops are oriented the other way: positive on the left and negative on the right. This is because the resistors are resisting the flow of electric charge being pushed by the battery.  <br/>
The sum of the voltage drops across R1, R2, and R3 equals 45 volts, which is the same as the battery’s output, except that the battery’s polarity is opposite that of the resistor voltage drops (negative left, positive right), so we end up with 0 volts measured across the whole string of components.<br/>

# Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)
**“The algebraic sum of all currents entering and exiting a node must equal zero.”** <br/>

This law is used to describe how a charge enters and leaves a wire junction point or node on a wire.<br/>
